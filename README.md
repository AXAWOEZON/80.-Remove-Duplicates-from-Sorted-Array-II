This code is a C++ solution to a problem of removing duplicates from a sorted array while allowing each unique element to appear at most twice. Let's break down the code:

Lambda Expression: The code starts with a lambda expression that adjusts the input-output synchronization of C++ standard streams (cin and cout) to improve performance.
Base Case Check: It checks if the input vector nums is empty. If it is, it returns 0 because there are no elements to process.
Pointers Initialization: Two pointers k and n are initialized. k is used to keep track of the position where the next non-duplicate element should be placed, and n counts the occurrences of the current element.
Main Loop: The loop iterates through the elements of the array starting from index 1.
Duplicate Check: Inside the loop, it checks if the element at the current index i is different from the element at index k. If it's different, it means a new non-duplicate element is found, so k is incremented, and the current element is placed at position k. n is reset to 1 because it's a new element.
Duplicate Handling: If the elements at indices k and i are the same, it means a duplicate is found. In this case, it further checks if n is less than 2. If n is less than 2, it means the current element has appeared less than twice, so it's safe to include one more occurrence. It increments k, places the current element at position k, and increments n. If n is already 2, it means the current element has already appeared twice, so it skips adding another occurrence.
Return: Finally, it returns the length of the modified array, which is k + 1, because k is 0-indexed, but we need to return the count of elements.
Overall, this algorithm efficiently removes duplicates from the sorted array while allowing each unique element to appear at most twice.
